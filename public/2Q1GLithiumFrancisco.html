        <h1>Ateneo de Manila University</h1>
        <section>
  <h2>Short History</h2>
  <p>
    Ateneo de Manila University was founded in 1859 by the Society of Jesus (Jesuits).
    Originally located in Intramuros, it began as the <em>Escuela Municipal de Manila</em>,
    which was the only primary school in the city at the time. In 1865, it was renamed
    <em>Ateneo Municipal de Manila</em>, and in the same year, secondary education was
    introduced. When American colonial rule began in 1902, the Ateneo Municipal lost its
    government subsidy.
  </p>
  <p>
    By 1908, the government recognized it as a college authorized to offer bachelor’s
    degrees and certificates in various fields, including electrical engineering.
    A year later, in 1909, the Jesuits officially removed the word “Municipal” from its
    name, and it has since been known as <em>Ateneo de Manila</em>. American Jesuits
    took administration in 1921, as a result of the Spanish being "exiled".
  </p>
  <p>
    During World War II, much of Ateneo was destroyed, with only one structure surviving,
    the statue of St. Joseph and the Child Jesus. After the war, the remaining structures
    were salvaged, and in 1952, the campus was rebuilt in Loyola Heights, which is now
    the largest of the four campuses, being 83 hectars big, ranking as the 8th largest university in the Philippines. Over time, three additional campuses were
    established within the National Capital Region (NCR).
