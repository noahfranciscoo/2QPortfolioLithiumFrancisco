        <h2>Ateneo de Manila University</h2>

        <h3>Short History</h3>
        <p>Ateneo de Manila University was founded in 1859 by the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). Originally located in Intramuros, it began as the Escuela Municipal de Manila, and at the time, it was the only primary school in Manila. Before being renamed to Ateneo Municipal de Manila in 1865, additionally, in the same year, secondary education was added. When American colonial rule came in 1902, the Ateneo Municipal lost its government subsidy. In 1908, the government recognized it as a college licensed to offer the bachelor’s degree and certificates in various majors, an example of which is electrical engineering. In 1909, the Jesuits finally removed the word “Municipal” from Ateneo’s official name, and it has since been known as the Ateneo de Manila. American Jesuits took over administration in 1921. During WW2, a majority of Ateneo was destroyed, and only 1 structure remained,  the statue of St. Joseph and the Child Jesus. After the war, the destroyed structures were salvaged. In 1952, the campus was rebuilt in Loyola Heights, now being the largest of the 4. Over time, 3 more campuses were built in the NCR.</p>
